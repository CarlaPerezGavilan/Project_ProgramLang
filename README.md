## Title of the project
_Language Parser_ - Identifies the programming language and identifies the used or reserved words 

## Description
#### Detailed description of the problem to be solved. Give as much information as possible. Assume the reader of the document is Jon Snow!
The problem we want to solve is understanding the structure of a programing language like Java or C++, for different main reasons, for example, checking for syntax errors in a piece of code
We are going to create a parse, the meaning of parse is: divide something into parts to examine each part individually. For out proyect we want to analyze relationships between components from a piece of code given.
The parse we want to develop is going to recieve commands and instructions and splits them into other pieces in programming, then checks if the information is enough to develop a data structure, with the main purpose of understanding the structure of the language given and for a purpose in the future like gathering information, data analysts, etcetera.
Specifically, our project will identify each programming language reserved keywords and change the color of each of them. It will also be able to identify variables and their type: global, constant, etc. 

## Programming Language
